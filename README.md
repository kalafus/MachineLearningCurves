# MachineLearningCurves

**MachineLearningCurves** is a collection of abstract papers, insights, and research notes focusing on various topics in machine learning. This repository aims to provide both theoretical explorations and practical implementations to help researchers and developers better understand key concepts in deep learning, neural networks, and related fields.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **Abstract Papers**
This section contains well-structured short papers covering different machine learning techniques, theories, and innovations. Each paper delves into a specific topic, offering a mix of conceptual insights, mathematical foundations, and potential applications.

**Papers include:**
- **Kalafus Initialization**: An improved approach to Xavier weight initialization by scaling based on the maximum of input and output sizes in lieu of the sum. Includes a glossary surveying documented randomized weight initialization distributions.
- **Novel Theory of the Mechanism of Non-Linearity in Activation Functions: A Comprehensive Theory for Neural Networks**: While the non-linear nature of neural networks is widely recognized as being caused by non-linear activation functions, the precise mechanism by which these functions introduce non-linearity has not been explained. We propose a novel theory that the crucial non-linearity instilled in machine learning by activation functions arises from their disruption of associativity of tensor operations. Also contains a glossary surveying documented activation functions.

### 2. **Research Notes**
Ongoing research ideas, experiment results, and explorations into machine learning techniques. These notes document insights as they develop, serving as a log of findings and thoughts.
